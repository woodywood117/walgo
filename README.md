# walgo
A write-ahead log written in Golang. I tried to write it with the Golang mindset
and using the standard library as much as possible. I also tried to make it
easy to use and understand.

## Note
This is not production ready. Please do not use it as is until I have a chance to update it.
You are free to use it as a base to implement your own write-ahead log.
